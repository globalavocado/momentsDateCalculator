# Moments Date Calculator

An internationalised browser app that calculates a date 6 weeks in advance from a calendar selection input and displays the result, including the weekday.

## technologies

- [jQuery 3.3.1](https://jquery.com/)
- [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) Datepicker
- [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/), a date calculation library with support for wide range of foreign languages
- [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) testing framework
- HTML/CSS3

## objectives

Selecting a date from the jQuery date picker places a date into the input. On clicking the button, the new date is calculated using the MomentJS library. Some localisation files are provided as an example, other languages can be downloaded and applied as required.

### project status

It works but has not been extensively tested yet.

## wish list
